Example of SVG image in `asciidoc`
==================================

below this text the image of a custom debian logo in `.svg` format is
shown, while the image itself is a `.svg` file.

during the making of this example I thought that this was no problem since it
rendered perfectly on my asciidoc preview in atom.io. But vieuwing it on github
failed

I was remembering that this worked. So the github wiki pages, as well as the
repository files don't render `.svg files. Please see the "broken" image below.

however, if an image is in a static site (like in a location somewhere in
my personal site) the image is rendered as it should.
